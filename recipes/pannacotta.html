    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 leaves of gelatine</li>
        <li>400 ml single cream</li>
        <li>100 g golden caster sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla bean paste</li>
        <li>400 g Greek-style yoghurt</li>
        <li>400 g strawberries</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons elderflower cordial</li>
        <li>2 sprigs of mint</li>
        <li>shortbread or ginger nut biscuits , to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>GET AHEAD Put the gelatine into a small bowl and cover with cold water. Pour the cream into a pan with the sugar and vanilla paste. Place on a medium-low heat until the mixture just starts to bubble, then turn the heat off. Remove the gelatine leaves from the water and whisk into the pan until melted, followed by the yoghurt. Once smooth and combined, divide between espresso cups, small glasses or moulds, place on a tray lined with kitchen paper (to prevent them sliding about), cool, cover and leave to set in the fridge overnight.</li>
        <li>ON THE DAY Hull and halve or quarter the strawberries, depending on their size. Mix with the cordial in a nice bowl and leave to macerate for an hour or so.</li>
        <li>TO SERVE Either serve the panna cotta in their cups, glasses or moulds, or turn them out on to little plates or saucers â€“ the easiest way to do this is by carefully dipping each cup into a bowl of boiling kettle water for 20 seconds, or until you get a wiggle, then place a plate on top and confidently flip out. Spoon over some strawberries and syrup, pick over a couple of cute baby mint leaves and tuck in. Delicious with a crumbling of bashed-up biscuits on the side.</li>
